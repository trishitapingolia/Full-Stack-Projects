This is the thoughtnote for Twitter clone project:


Frontend:
All Pages -> Feed.js Login.js Register.js Profile.js
The design is similar to the ones in problem statement
Success and Error handling using Toastify
Authentication working properly except-> user is getting logged out while any post,put req.
All code is neat and properly structured


Backend:
All APIs are working properly
user and tweet Schema defined properly for MongoDb
appropriate success, error messagees and appropriate status codes sent are  when required
Image upload is not working properly
ALl code is neat and are in structured folders.

Problem Areas-> Frontend is not responsive
		 Connection of Backend to Frontend is lacking in most areas.
